~~Hi there ðŸ‘‹~~ fuck this I hate emojis


Let's try it again :

# Hi! 

My username on github is JcdeA.

I am a random middle schooler you probably have never heard about. 

I am also an amateur dev by night. I don't really develop stuff that's very advanced right now, so don't expect too much from me.

I'm experienced in Python, but has some experience with other langauges such as: 
  
  *Javascript
  *little bit of C/ C++
  *shell scripting
  ... and more.
  
I am also active on reddit subs such as:
  *r/linuxmasterrace
  *r/programmerhumor(so many reposts)
  *r/linux
  *r/samsung
  ..and more.
  
I am also an avid Linux user(the name GNU/Linux is just stupid imo)
